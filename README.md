## I am Kah Shin, a student pursuing a Diploma in Applied AI & Analytics.

This is my little stepping stone to increase my presence online by actively updating personal repositories on Github! :metal:
As a Student, i've always loved to tinker in mini projects whenever i am free and i hope to meet more people with similiar interests in developing anything that will make a difference to others! :smile:
